        I was blessed to be born in the beautiful town of Mendefera, nestled in the heart of Eritrea. 
        During my formative years, I attended the esteemed Adi Ugri Elementary school and San Giorgio Middle School, 
        where I developed a love for learning and a passion for excellence. In 2012, I embarked on a journey of 
        discovery and growth, leaving my homeland to settle in Sudan. During my stay, I was blessed to meet many 
        wonderful people and experience different cultures, broadening my worldview and enriching my life in ways 
        I could have never imagined. Eventually, the call to pursue my dreams led me to the land of opportunities, 
        America. After arriving in 2014, I began to carve out my path, finishing my high school studies at the 
        prestigious Decatur Central High School in Indianapolis, Indiana. Fuelled by an unquenchable thirst for 
        knowledge and a fierce determination to succeed, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science 
        at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). After years of hard work and dedication, 
        I graduated in December 2022, earning my Bachelor of Science Degree.Today, 
        I am privileged to be working as a Software Engineer at one of the world's largest and 
        most respected financial institutions. As I continue to grow and evolve, 
        I remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible, 
        using my skills and talents to make a meaningful difference in the world.
